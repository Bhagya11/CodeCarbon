# ðŸ§  TransGraph-ASD: Multi-Modal Transformer-GNN for ASD Prediction

TransGraph-ASD is a deep learning framework built with PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric that integrates sMRI imaging and phenotypic data to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It leverages Vision Transformers (ViT), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and cross-modal attention, enhanced with uncertainty quantification and energy/resource tracking.
